# 👋 Hi, I'm Peter

💡 Passionate about **C / C++ programming** and **embedded systems development**.  
🔌 I love working close to the hardware — microcontrollers, sensors, and IoT devices.  
📚 Currently learning more about **ARM Cortex, STM32, and Arduino/ESP32** platforms.  
🛠️ Open to collaborating on **embedded projects** or anything low-level and performance-critical.
